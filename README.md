# 🔢 Number Guessing Game

## Purpose  
This is a simple command-line number guessing game built in Python. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 20, and the player tries to guess it. After each attempt, the game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

## Key Concepts Practiced  
- `while` loops  
- Conditionals (`if`, `elif`)  
- Functions and variable scope  
- User interaction through terminal  
- Random number generation

## Technologies Used  
- Python 3.x  
- `random` module  
- No external dependencies

## Features  
- Infinite loop with the option to play again  
- Dynamic feedback on guess accuracy  
- Simple and clean CLI menu  
- Tracks number of attempts (partially implemented)
